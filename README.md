# **Terraform AWS WorkSpaces Deployment**

This Terraform project automates the deployment of an **Amazon WorkSpace** in your AWS account. It includes the creation of a **Simple AD directory**, a **security group**, and the **WorkSpace instance** itself. The configuration is modular, with the provider settings separated into its own file for better maintainability.

## **Prerequisites**

Before deploying this Terraform project, ensure you have the following:

- **AWS Account**: An active AWS account with sufficient permissions to create resources like VPCs, subnets, directories, and WorkSpaces.
- **Terraform Installed**: Install Terraform on your local machine. You can download it from [here](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html).
- **AWS CLI Configured**: Ensure your AWS CLI is configured with the necessary credentials. Alternatively, you can use environment variables or IAM roles.
- **VPC and Subnets**: A pre-existing VPC with at least two private subnets in different Availability Zones. These subnets should have internet access via a NAT Gateway.

## **Project Structure**

The project is organized into the following files:

```
terraform-workspaces/
├── provider.tf       # AWS provider configuration
├── main.tf           # Core Terraform resources (directory, security group, WorkSpace)
├── variables.tf      # Input variables for flexibility
├── outputs.tf        # Outputs for useful information after deployment
└── README.md         # This documentation file
```

---

## **Setup Instructions**

### 1. Clone the Repository

If this project is hosted in a Git repository, clone it to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/terraform-workspaces.git
cd terraform-workspaces
```

### 2. Configure AWS Credentials

You can configure AWS credentials in one of the following ways:

#### Option 1: Environment Variables
Set your AWS credentials as environment variables:

```bash
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=""
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=""
```

#### Option 2: Shared Credentials File
Use the AWS CLI to configure your credentials:

```bash
aws configure
```

This will store your credentials in the `~/.aws/credentials` file.

### 3. Update Configuration Files

- Open `main.tf` and replace the placeholders (`vpc-xxxxxxxx`, `subnet-xxxxxxxx`, etc.) with your actual VPC and subnet IDs.
- If needed, update the `variables.tf` file to customize input values.

---

## **Deployment Steps**

### 1. Initialize Terraform

Run the following command to initialize Terraform and download the required providers:

```bash
terraform init
```

### 2. Plan the Deployment

Preview the changes Terraform will make to your AWS account:

```bash
terraform plan
```

### 3. Apply the Configuration

Deploy the resources to your AWS account:

```bash
terraform apply
```

When prompted, type `yes` to confirm the deployment.

### 4. Destroy Resources (Optional)

To clean up and delete all resources created by Terraform:

```bash
terraform destroy
```

## **Accessing the WorkSpace**

After deploying the WorkSpace, follow these steps to access it:

1. **Install the AWS WorkSpaces Client**:
   - Download the client for your platform from [here](https://clients.amazonworkspaces.com/).

2. **Retrieve the Registration Code**:
   - Go to the AWS Management Console > **WorkSpaces** service.
   - Find your WorkSpace and retrieve the **Registration Code** under "Quick Links."

3. **Register the WorkSpace**:
   - Launch the AWS WorkSpaces client and enter the registration code.
   - Log in with the username (`admin`) and password you specified in the Terraform configuration.

4. **Web Access**:
   - Alternatively, access the WorkSpace via a web browser at [https://clients.amazonworkspaces.com/](https://clients.amazonworkspaces.com/).

---

## **Troubleshooting**

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Malformed VPC or Subnet IDs**:
   - Ensure the VPC and subnet IDs in `main.tf` are valid and exist in your AWS account.
   - Verify the IDs using the AWS Management Console or CLI.

2. **Unable to Connect to the WorkSpace**:
   - Check if the WorkSpace is in the **AVAILABLE** state in the AWS Console.
   - Ensure the security group allows inbound traffic on port 443 (HTTPS).

3. **Incorrect Password**:
   - Reset the password for the user in the AWS Directory Service console.

4. **Client Not Working**:
   - Use the latest version of the AWS WorkSpaces client.
   - For web access, use Chrome or Firefox.
